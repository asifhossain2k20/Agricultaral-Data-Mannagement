Production As the potato plants become mature and the tubers are fully formed, the leaves become gradually yellowish and then brownish, and finally the plants die. It is always better to harvest the crop after these signs are evident in the field. Most varieties are harvested in this country during February-March. Collection of the tubers is usually done in Bangladesh manually using a spade or other devices.In volume of fresh product, the potato ranks first among the world's most important food crops. It is grown in almost all countries of the world. In many countries, including those of Europe, America, and Canada, potato is the staple food. Nearly 90% of the potato crop of the world is grown in Europe. In the last 2-3 decades, production of potato in Bangladesh has increased with the cultivation of high yielding varieties. Although the growing conditions are excellent, because of lack of desirable market, farmers do not like to grow more potatoes. Only a negligible portion of the total production is exported, while a substantial amount of seed potatoes are still imported.
Production of seed potato In Bangladesh potato is grown in an area of about 8,06,294 acres. For this purpose about 3,50,000 m tons of seed potatoes are necessary. Most of the seeds used are not of high quality. The farmers generally use the tubers they keep for their own consumption as seeds. This results in poor yield in the following season.
