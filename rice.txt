The dominant food crop of Bangladesh is rice, accounting for about 75 percent of agricultural land use (and 28 percent of GDP). Bangladesh was the fourth largest rice producer in the world, but its productivity was low compared with other Asian countries.
Sources at Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) say the number of developed and released rice varieties by the state-run rice research body currently stands at 81. Of them, 25 are varieties of Boro, 36 of Aman and 10 are Aush. In addition, Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA) has developed another 18 rice varieties since its inception.
