****CULTIVATION****

Cultivation Potato is widely cultivated in all the districts of Bangladesh during winter. Of the total 3,36,740 acres (1,36,332 ha) of land used for potato cultivation during 1997-98, 1,13,540, 2,18,445, and 4,755 acres were for local, high yielding, and Indian varieties respectively. Well-fertilized, sunny land with sufficient moisture in soil is appropriate for potato plantation. The first fortnight of November is the right time. In certain northwestern areas, farmers even plant potato in October to harvest the crop early. Virtually all potatoes in this country are planted manually. On the basis of the soil quality and potato variety farmers determine the spacing in between the seed tubers and the adjacent rows. Row spacing is usually from 45 to 60 cm. Optimum depth of planting depends on temperature and moisture of the soil, probable weather following planting, and mode of conducting field operations later. If planting is shallow and only about 5 cm deep, the soil must be gradually ridged over the row incidental to cultivation. This ensures that the developing tubers are well covered with soil to protect them from light and pests. Mulching is frequently done over the rows with waterhyacinth, straw etc to preserve the soil moisture and to prevent the growth of weeds.
