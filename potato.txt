******About Potato*****

Potato (alu) edible tuber of the cultivated plant Solanum tuberosum of the family Solanaceae. It was the major crop for the original Americans. It is now one of the staple foods in Bangladesh. Its history is difficult to trace, partly because the name potato was also used by early writers for the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and for other unrelated plants.
The potato plant is a herbaceous annual, normally propagated by planting pieces of tubers that bear two or three eyes. Nutritionally, the tuber is rich in carbohydrates or starch and is a good source of protein, vitamin C and the B vitamins, potassium, phosphorus, and iron. Most of the minerals and protein are concentrated in a thin layer beneath the skin, and the skin itself is a source of food fibre.
